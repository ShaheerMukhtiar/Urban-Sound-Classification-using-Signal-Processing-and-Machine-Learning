# 🎧Urban-Sound-Classification-using-Signal-Processing-and-Machine-Learning

This project implements an audio classification system capable of categorizing urban sound signals into **speech**, **music**, and **noise** using classical **signal processing techniques** and a **Random Forest Classifier**. It uses the [UrbanSound8K](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html) dataset and evaluates model robustness under various noise conditions.
